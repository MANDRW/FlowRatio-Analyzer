# FlowRatio Analyzer – CNN-Based Classification of Extrusion Flow Ratio in FDM 3D Printing

A system for classifying flow-ratio calibration blocks in FDM 3D printing using convolutional neural networks.

## About

FlowRatio Analyzer is a machine-learning project developed for an engineering thesis.  
The system analyzes images of 3D-printed calibration blocks and classifies them into three categories:

- **Under-extrude**  
- **Optimal extrusion**  
- **Over-extrude**

The project includes a complete pipeline: dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, and comparison of architectures.
